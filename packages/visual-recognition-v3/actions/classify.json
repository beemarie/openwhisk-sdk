Username and password credentials are only required to run your application locally or outside of IBM Cloud. When running on IBM Cloud, the credentials will be automatically loaded from the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable."},

Responsibility falls on the application to refresh the token, either before it expires or reactively upon receiving a 401 from the service, as any requests made with an expired token will fail."},

Include no more than 20 images and limit the .zip file to 100 MB. Encode the image and .zip file names in UTF-8 if they contain non-ASCII characters. The service assumes UTF-8 encoding if it encounters non-ASCII characters.  You can also include an image with the **url** parameter."},

The full set of languages is supported only for the built-in `default` classifier ID. The class names of custom classifiers are not translated.  The response might not be in the specified language when the requested language is not supported or when there is no translation for the class name."},

Use `IBM` to classify against the `default` general classifier, and use `me` to classify against your custom classifiers. To analyze the image against both classifier categories, set the value to both `IBM` and `me`.   The built-in `default` classifier is used if both **classifier_ids** and **owners** parameters are empty.  The **classifier_ids** parameter overrides **owners**, so make sure that **classifier_ids** is empty."},

You can specify both custom and built-in classifier IDs. The built-in `default` classifier is used if both **classifier_ids** and **owners** parameters are empty.  The following built-in classifier IDs require no training: - `default`: Returns classes from thousands of general tags. - `food`: (Beta) Enhances specificity and accuracy for images of food items. - `explicit`: (Beta) Evaluates whether the image might be pornographic."},
