/**
 * List custom models.
 *
 * Lists metadata such as the name and description for all custom voice models that are owned by an instance of the
 * service. Specify a language to list the voice models for that language only. To see the words in addition to the
 * metadata for a specific voice model, use the **List a custom model** method. You must use credentials for the
 * instance of the service that owns a model to list information about it.
 *
 * **Note:** This method is currently a beta release.
 *
 * @param {Object} params - The parameters to send to the service.
 * @param {string} [params.username] - The username used to authenticate with the service. Username and password credentials are only required to run your application locally or outside of Bluemix. When running on Bluemix, the credentials will be automatically loaded from the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.
 * @param {string} [params.password] - The password used to authenticate with the service. Username and password credentials are only required to run your application locally or outside of Bluemix. When running on Bluemix, the credentials will be automatically loaded from the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.
 * @param {string} [params.iam_access_token] - An IAM access token fully managed by the application. Responsibility falls on the application to refresh the token, either before it expires or reactively upon receiving a 401 from the service, as any requests made with an expired token will fail.
 * @param {string} [params.iam_apikey] - An API key that can be used to request IAM tokens. If this API key is provided, the SDK will manage the token and handle the refreshing.
 * @param {string} [params.iam_url] - An optional URL for the IAM service API. Defaults to 'https://iam.bluemix.net/identity/token'.
 * @param {Object} [params.headers] - Custom HTTP request headers
 * @param {boolean} [params.headers.X-Watson-Learning-Opt-Out=false] - opt-out of data collection
 * @param {string} [params.url] - override default service base url
 * @param {string} [params.language] - The language for which custom voice models that are owned by the requesting
 * service credentials are to be returned. Omit the parameter to see all custom voice models that are owned by the
 * requester.
 * @return {Promise} - The Promise that the action returns.
