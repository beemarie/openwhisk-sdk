 "parameters":
 [
   {"name":"username", "required":false, "bindTime":true, "description":"The username used to authenticate with the service. Username and password credentials are only required to run your application locally or outside of IBM Cloud. When running on IBM Cloud, the credentials will be automatically loaded from the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable."},
   {"name":"password", "required":false, "bindTime":true, "description":"The password used to authenticate with the service. Username and password credentials are only required to run your application locally or outside of IBM Cloud. When running on IBM Cloud, the credentials will be automatically loaded from the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable."},
   {"name":"iam_access_token", "required":false, "bindTime":true, "description":"An IAM access token fully managed by the application. Responsibility falls on the application to refresh the token, either before it expires or reactively upon receiving a 401 from the service, as any requests made with an expired token will fail."},
   {"name":"iam_apikey", "required":false, "bindTime":true, "description":"An API key that can be used to request IAM tokens. If this API key is provided, the SDK will manage the token and handle the refreshing."},
   {"name":"iam_url", "required":false, "bindTime":true, "description":"An optional URL for the IAM service API. Defaults to 'https://iam.ng.bluemix.net/identity/token"},
   {"name":"headers", "required":false, "bindTime":true, "description":"The request headers"},
   {"name":"headers[X-Watson-Learning-Opt-Out]", "required":false, "bindTime":true, "description":"opt-out of data collection"},
   {"name":"url", "required":false, "bindTime":true, "description":"override default service base url"},
   {"name":"audio", "required":true, "bindTime":false, "description":"The audio to transcribe in the format specified by the `Content-Type` header."},
   {"name":"content_type", "required":true, "bindTime":false, "description":"The type of the input: audio/basic, audio/flac, audio/l16, audio/mp3, audio/mpeg, audio/mulaw, audio/ogg, audio/ogg;codecs=opus, audio/ogg;codecs=vorbis, audio/wav, audio/webm, audio/webm;codecs=opus, or audio/webm;codecs=vorbis."},
   {"name":"model", "required":false, "bindTime":false, "description":"The identifier of the model that is to be used for the recognition request or, for the **Create a session** method, with the new session."},
   {"name":"customization_id", "required":false, "bindTime":false, "description":"The customization ID (GUID) of a custom language model that is to be used with the recognition request or, for the **Create a session** method, with the new session. The base model of the specified custom language model must match the model specified with the `model` parameter. You must make the request with service credentials created for the instance of the service that owns the custom model. By default, no custom language model is used."},
   {"name":"acoustic_customization_id", "required":false, "bindTime":false, "description":"The customization ID (GUID) of a custom acoustic model that is to be used with the recognition request or, for the **Create a session** method, with the new session. The base model of the specified custom acoustic model must match the model specified with the `model` parameter. You must make the request with service credentials created for the instance of the service that owns the custom model. By default, no custom acoustic model is used."},
   {"name":"base_model_version", "required":false, "bindTime":false, "description":"The version of the specified base model that is to be used with recognition request or, for the **Create a session** method, with the new session. Multiple versions of a base model can exist when a model is updated for internal improvements. The parameter is intended primarily for use with custom models that have been upgraded for a new base model. The default value depends on whether the parameter is used with or without a custom model. For more information, see [Base model version](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#version)."},
   {"name":"customization_weight", "required":false, "bindTime":false, "description":"If you specify the customization ID (GUID) of a custom language model with the recognition request or, for sessions, with the **Create a session** method, the customization weight tells the service how much weight to give to words from the custom language model compared to those from the base model for the current request.   Specify a value between 0.0 and 1.0. Unless a different customization weight was specified for the custom model when it was trained, the default value is 0.3. A customization weight that you specify overrides a weight that was specified when the custom model was trained.   The default value yields the best performance in general. Assign a higher value if your audio makes frequent use of OOV words from the custom model. Use caution when setting the weight: a higher value can improve the accuracy of phrases from the custom model's domain, but it can negatively affect performance on non-domain phrases."},
   {"name":"inactivity_timeout", "required":false, "bindTime":false, "description":"The time in seconds after which, if only silence (no speech) is detected in submitted audio, the connection is closed with a 400 error. Useful for stopping audio submission from a live microphone when a user simply walks away. Use `-1` for infinity."},
   {"name":"keywords", "required":false, "bindTime":false, "description":"An array of keyword strings to spot in the audio. Each keyword string can include one or more tokens. Keywords are spotted only in the final hypothesis, not in interim results. If you specify any keywords, you must also specify a keywords threshold. You can spot a maximum of 1000 keywords. Omit the parameter or specify an empty array if you do not need to spot keywords."},
   {"name":"keywords_threshold", "required":false, "bindTime":false, "description":"A confidence value that is the lower bound for spotting a keyword. A word is considered to match a keyword if its confidence is greater than or equal to the threshold. Specify a probability between 0 and 1 inclusive. No keyword spotting is performed if you omit the parameter. If you specify a threshold, you must also specify one or more keywords."},
   {"name":"max_alternatives", "required":false, "bindTime":false, "description":"The maximum number of alternative transcripts to be returned. By default, a single transcription is returned."},
   {"name":"word_alternatives_threshold", "required":false, "bindTime":false, "description":"A confidence value that is the lower bound for identifying a hypothesis as a possible word alternative (also known as 'Confusion Networks'). An alternative word is considered if its confidence is greater than or equal to the threshold. Specify a probability between 0 and 1 inclusive. No alternative words are computed if you omit the parameter."},
   {"name":"word_confidence", "required":false, "bindTime":false, "description":"If `true`, a confidence measure in the range of 0 to 1 is returned for each word. By default, no word confidence measures are returned."},
   {"name":"timestamps", "required":false, "bindTime":false, "description":"If `true`, time alignment is returned for each word. By default, no timestamps are returned."},
   {"name":"profanity_filter", "required":false, "bindTime":false, "description":"If `true` (the default), filters profanity from all output except for keyword results by replacing inappropriate words with a series of asterisks. Set the parameter to `false` to return results with no censoring. Applies to US English transcription only."},
   {"name":"smart_formatting", "required":false, "bindTime":false, "description":"If `true`, converts dates, times, series of digits and numbers, phone numbers, currency values, and internet addresses into more readable, conventional representations in the final transcript of a recognition request. For US English, also converts certain keyword strings to punctuation symbols. By default, no smart formatting is performed. Applies to US English and Spanish transcription only."},
   {"name":"speaker_labels", "required":false, "bindTime":false, "description":"If `true`, the response includes labels that identify which words were spoken by which participants in a multi-person exchange. By default, no speaker labels are returned. Setting `speaker_labels` to `true` forces the `timestamps` parameter to be `true`, regardless of whether you specify `false` for the parameter.   To determine whether a language model supports speaker labels, use the **Get models** method and check that the attribute `speaker_labels` is set to `true`. You can also refer to [Speaker labels](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#speaker_labels)."}
