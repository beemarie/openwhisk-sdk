/**
 * Upgrade a custom language model.
 *
 * Initiates the upgrade of a custom language model to the latest version of its base language model. The upgrade method
 * is asynchronous. It can take on the order of minutes to complete depending on the amount of data in the custom model
 * and the current load on the service. A custom model must be in the `ready` or `available` state to be upgraded. You
 * must use credentials for the instance of the service that owns a model to upgrade it.
 *
 * The method returns an HTTP 200 response code to indicate that the upgrade process has begun successfully. You can
 * monitor the status of the upgrade by using the **Get a custom language model** method to poll the model's status. The
 * method returns a `LanguageModel` object that includes `status` and `progress` fields. Use a loop to check the status
 * every 10 seconds. While it is being upgraded, the custom model has the status `upgrading`. When the upgrade is
 * complete, the model resumes the status that it had prior to upgrade. The service cannot accept subsequent requests
 * for the model until the upgrade completes.
 *
 * For more information, see [Upgrading custom
 * models](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/custom-upgrade.html).
 *
 * @param {Object} params - The parameters to send to the service.
 * @param {string} [params.username] - The username used to authenticate with the service. Username and password credentials are only required to run your application locally or outside of Bluemix. When running on Bluemix, the credentials will be automatically loaded from the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.
 * @param {string} [params.password] - The password used to authenticate with the service. Username and password credentials are only required to run your application locally or outside of Bluemix. When running on Bluemix, the credentials will be automatically loaded from the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.
 * @param {string} [params.iam_access_token] - An IAM access token fully managed by the application. Responsibility falls on the application to refresh the token, either before it expires or reactively upon receiving a 401 from the service, as any requests made with an expired token will fail.
 * @param {string} [params.iam_apikey] - An API key that can be used to request IAM tokens. If this API key is provided, the SDK will manage the token and handle the refreshing.
 * @param {string} [params.iam_url] - An optional URL for the IAM service API. Defaults to 'https://iam.bluemix.net/identity/token'.
 * @param {Object} [params.headers] - Custom HTTP request headers
 * @param {boolean} [params.headers.X-Watson-Learning-Opt-Out=false] - opt-out of data collection
 * @param {string} [params.url] - override default service base url
 * @param {string} params.customization_id - The customization ID (GUID) of the custom language model. You must make the
 * request with service credentials created for the instance of the service that owns the custom model.
 * @return {Promise} - The Promise that the action returns.
