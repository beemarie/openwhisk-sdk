/**
 * Resets a custom acoustic model.
 *
 * Resets a custom acoustic model by removing all audio resources from the model. Resetting a custom acoustic model initializes the model to its state when it was first created. Metadata such as the name and language of the model are preserved, but the model's audio resources are removed and must be re-created. You must use credentials for the instance of the service that owns a model to reset it.
 *
 * @param {Object} params - The parameters to send to the service.
 * @param {string} [params.username] - required unless use_unauthenticated is set.
 * @param {string} [params.password] - required unless use_unauthenticated is set.
 * @param {Object} [params.headers]
 * @param {boolean} [params.headers.X-Watson-Learning-Opt-Out=false] - opt-out of data collection
 * @param {string} [params.url] - override default service base url
 * @param {string} params.customization_id - The GUID of the custom acoustic model that is to be reset. You must make the request with service credentials created for the instance of the service that owns the custom model.
 * @return {Promise} - The Promise that the action returns.
