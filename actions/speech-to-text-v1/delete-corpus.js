/**
 * Delete a corpus.
 *
 * Deletes an existing corpus from a custom language model. The service removes any out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words associated with the corpus from the custom model's words resource unless they were also added by another corpus or they have been modified in some way with the **Add custom words** or **Add a custom word** method. Removing a corpus does not affect the custom model until you train the model with the **Train a custom language model** method. You must use credentials for the instance of the service that owns a model to delete its corpora.
 *
 * @param {Object} params - The parameters to send to the service.
 * @param {string} [params.username] - The username used to authenticate with the service. Username and password credentials are only required to run your application locally or outside of Bluemix. When running on Bluemix, the credentials will be automatically loaded from the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.
 * @param {string} [params.password] - The password used to authenticate with the service. Username and password credentials are only required to run your application locally or outside of Bluemix. When running on Bluemix, the credentials will be automatically loaded from the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.
 * @param {Object} [params.headers] - Custom HTTP request headers
 * @param {boolean} [params.headers.X-Watson-Learning-Opt-Out=false] - opt-out of data collection
 * @param {string} [params.url] - override default service base url
 * @param {string} params.customization_id - The GUID of the custom language model from which a corpus is to be deleted. You must make the request with service credentials created for the instance of the service that owns the custom model.
 * @param {string} params.corpus_name - The name of the corpus that is to be deleted from the custom language model.
 * @return {Promise} - The Promise that the action returns.
