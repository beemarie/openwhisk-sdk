/**
 * Add an audio resource.
 *
 * Adds an audio resource to a custom acoustic model. Add audio content that reflects the acoustic characteristics of the audio that you plan to transcribe. You must use credentials for the instance of the service that owns a model to add an audio resource to it. Adding audio data does not affect the custom acoustic model until you train the model for the new data by using the **Train a custom acoustic model** method.   You can add individual audio files or an archive file that contains multiple audio files. Adding multiple audio files via a single archive file is significantly more efficient than adding each file individually. * You can add an individual audio file in any format that the service supports for speech recognition. Use the `Content-Type` header to specify the format of the audio file. * You can add an archive file (**.zip** or **.tar.gz** file) that contains audio files in any format that the service supports for speech recognition. All audio files added with the same archive file must have the same audio format. Use the `Content-Type` header to specify the archive type, `application/zip` or `application/gzip`. Use the `Contained-Content-Type` header to specify the format of the contained audio files; the default format is `audio/wav`.   You can use this method to add any number of audio resources to a custom model by calling the method once for each audio or archive file. But the addition of one audio resource must be fully complete before you can add another. You must add a minimum of 10 minutes and a maximum of 50 hours of audio that includes speech, not just silence, to a custom acoustic model before you can train it. No audio resource, audio- or archive-type, can be larger than 100 MB.   The method is asynchronous. It can take several seconds to complete depending on the duration of the audio and, in the case of an archive file, the total number of audio files being processed. The service returns a 201 response code if the audio is valid. It then asynchronously analyzes the contents of the audio file or files and automatically extracts information about the audio such as its length, sampling rate, and encoding. You cannot submit requests to add additional audio resources to a custom acoustic model, or to train the model, until the service's analysis of all audio files for the current request completes.   To determine the status of the service's analysis of the audio, use the **List an audio resource** method to poll the status of the audio. The method accepts the GUID of the custom model and the name of the audio resource, and it returns the status of the resource. Use a loop to check the status of the audio every few seconds until it becomes `ok`.   **Note:** The sampling rate of an audio file must match the sampling rate of the base model for the custom model: for broadband models, at least 16 kHz; for narrowband models, at least 8 kHz. If the sampling rate of the audio is higher than the minimum required rate, the service down-samples the audio to the appropriate rate. If the sampling rate of the audio is lower than the minimum required rate, the service labels the audio file as `invalid`.
 *
 * @param {Object} params - The parameters to send to the service.
 * @param {string} [params.username] - The username used to authenticate with the service. Username and password credentials are only required to run your application locally or outside of Bluemix. When running on Bluemix, the credentials will be automatically loaded from the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.
 * @param {string} [params.password] - The password used to authenticate with the service. Username and password credentials are only required to run your application locally or outside of Bluemix. When running on Bluemix, the credentials will be automatically loaded from the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.
 * @param {Object} [params.headers] - Custom HTTP request headers
 * @param {boolean} [params.headers.X-Watson-Learning-Opt-Out=false] - opt-out of data collection
 * @param {string} [params.url] - override default service base url
 * @param {string} params.customization_id - The GUID of the custom acoustic model to which an audio resource is to be added. You must make the request with service credentials created for the instance of the service that owns the custom model.
 * @param {string} params.audio_name - The name of the audio resource that is to be added to the custom acoustic model. The name cannot contain spaces. Use a localized name that matches the language of the custom model.
 * @param {ReadableStream|FileObject|Buffer} params.audio_resource - The audio resource that is to be added to the custom acoustic model, an individual audio file or an archive file.
 * @param {string} params.content_type - The type of the input: application/zip, application/gzip, audio/basic, audio/flac, audio/l16, audio/mp3, audio/mpeg, audio/mulaw, audio/ogg, audio/ogg;codecs=opus, audio/ogg;codecs=vorbis, audio/wav, audio/webm, audio/webm;codecs=opus, or audio/webm;codecs=vorbis.
 * @param {string} [params.contained_content_type] - For an archive-type resource that contains audio files whose format is not `audio/wav`, specifies the format of the audio files. The header accepts all of the audio formats supported for use with speech recognition and with the `Content-Type` header, including the `rate`, `channels`, and `endianness` parameters that are used with some formats. For a complete list of supported audio formats, see [Audio formats](/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#formats).
 * @param {boolean} [params.allow_overwrite] - Indicates whether the specified audio resource is to overwrite an existing resource with the same name. If a resource with the same name already exists, the request fails unless `allow_overwrite` is set to `true`; by default, the parameter is `false`. The parameter has no effect if a resource with the same name does not already exist.
 * @return {Promise} - The Promise that the action returns.
