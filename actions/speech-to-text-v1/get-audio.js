/**
 * List an audio resource.
 *
 * Lists information about an audio resource from a custom acoustic model. The method returns an `AudioListing` object whose fields depend on the type of audio resource you specify with the method's `audio_name` parameter: * **For an audio-type resource,** the object's fields match those of an `AudioResource` object: `duration`, `name`, `details`, and `status`. * **For an archive-type resource,** the object includes a `container` field whose fields match those of an `AudioResource` object. It also includes an `audio` field, which contains an array of `AudioResource` objects that provides information about the audio files that are contained in the archive.   The information includes the status of the specified audio resource, which is important for checking the service's analysis of the resource in response to a request to add it to the custom model. You must use credentials for the instance of the service that owns a model to list its audio resources.
 *
 * @param {Object} params - The parameters to send to the service.
 * @param {string} [params.username] - The username used to authenticate with the service. Username and password credentials are only required to run your application locally or outside of Bluemix. When running on Bluemix, the credentials will be automatically loaded from the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.
 * @param {string} [params.password] - The password used to authenticate with the service. Username and password credentials are only required to run your application locally or outside of Bluemix. When running on Bluemix, the credentials will be automatically loaded from the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.
 * @param {Object} [params.headers] - Custom HTTP request headers
 * @param {boolean} [params.headers.X-Watson-Learning-Opt-Out=false] - opt-out of data collection
 * @param {string} [params.url] - override default service base url
 * @param {string} params.customization_id - The GUID of the custom acoustic model for which an audio resource is to be listed. You must make the request with service credentials created for the instance of the service that owns the custom model.
 * @param {string} params.audio_name - The name of the audio resource about which information is to be listed.
 * @return {Promise} - The Promise that the action returns.
