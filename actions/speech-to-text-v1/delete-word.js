/**
 * Delete a custom word.
 *
 * Deletes a custom word from a custom language model. You can remove any word that you added to the custom model's words resource via any means. However, if the word also exists in the service's base vocabulary, the service removes only the custom pronunciation for the word; the word remains in the base vocabulary. Removing a custom word does not affect the custom model until you train the model with the **Train a custom language model** method. You must use credentials for the instance of the service that owns a model to delete its words.
 *
 * @param {Object} params - The parameters to send to the service.
 * @param {string} [params.username] - required unless use_unauthenticated is set.
 * @param {string} [params.password] - required unless use_unauthenticated is set.
 * @param {Object} [params.headers]
 * @param {boolean} [params.headers.X-Watson-Learning-Opt-Out=false] - opt-out of data collection
 * @param {string} [params.url] - override default service base url
 * @param {string} params.customization_id - The GUID of the custom language model from which a word is to be deleted. You must make the request with service credentials created for the instance of the service that owns the custom model.
 * @param {string} params.word_name - The custom word that is to be deleted from the custom language model.
 * @return {Promise} - The Promise that the action returns.
