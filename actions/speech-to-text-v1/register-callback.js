/**
 * Registers a callback URL for use with the asynchronous interface.
 *
 * @param {Object} params - The parameters to send to the service.
 * @param {string} [params.username] - required unless use_unauthenticated is set.
 * @param {string} [params.password] - required unless use_unauthenticated is set.
 * @param {Object} [params.headers]
 * @param {boolean} [params.headers.X-Watson-Learning-Opt-Out=false] - opt-out of data collection
 * @param {string} [params.url] - override default service base url
 * @param {string} params.callback_url - An HTTP or HTTPS URL to which callback notifications are to be sent. To be white-listed, the URL must successfully echo the challenge string during URL verification. During verification, the client can also check the signature that the service sends in the `X-Callback-Signature` header to verify the origin of the request.
 * @param {string} [params.user_secret] - A user-specified string that the service uses to generate the HMAC-SHA1 signature that it sends via the `X-Callback-Signature` header. The service includes the header during URL verification and with every notification sent to the callback URL. It calculates the signature over the payload of the notification. If you omit the parameter, the service does not send the header.
 * @return {Promise} - The Promise that the action returns.
