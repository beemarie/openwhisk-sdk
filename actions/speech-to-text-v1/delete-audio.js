/**
 * Deletes an audio resource from a custom acoustic model.
 *
 * Deletes an existing audio resource from a custom acoustic model. Deleting an archive-type audio resource removes the entire archive of files; the current interface does not allow deletion of individual files from an archive resource. Removing an audio resource does not affect the custom model until you train the model on its updated data by using the `POST /v1/acoustic_customizations/{customization_id}/train` method. You must use credentials for the instance of the service that owns a model to delete its audio resources.
 *
 * @param {Object} params - The parameters to send to the service.
 * @param {string} [params.username] - required unless use_unauthenticated is set.
 * @param {string} [params.password] - required unless use_unauthenticated is set.
 * @param {Object} [params.headers]
 * @param {boolean} [params.headers.X-Watson-Learning-Opt-Out=false] - opt-out of data collection
 * @param {string} [params.url] - override default service base url
 * @param {string} params.customization_id - The GUID of the custom acoustic model from which an audio resource is to be deleted. You must make the request with service credentials created for the instance of the service that owns the custom model.
 * @param {string} params.audio_name - The name of the audio resource that is to be deleted from the custom acoustic model.
 * @return {Promise} - The Promise that the action returns.
