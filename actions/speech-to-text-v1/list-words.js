/**
 * Lists all custom words from a custom language model.
 *
 * @param {Object} params - The parameters to send to the service.
 * @param {string} [params.username] - required unless use_unauthenticated is set.
 * @param {string} [params.password] - required unless use_unauthenticated is set.
 * @param {Object} [params.headers]
 * @param {boolean} [params.headers.X-Watson-Learning-Opt-Out=false] - opt-out of data collection
 * @param {string} [params.url] - override default service base url
 * @param {string} params.customization_id - The GUID of the custom language model from which words are to be queried. You must make the request with service credentials created for the instance of the service that owns the custom model.
 * @param {string} [params.word_type] - The type of words to be listed from the custom language model's words resource: * `all` (the default) shows all words. * `user` shows only custom words that were added or modified by the user. * `corpora` shows only OOV that were extracted from corpora.
 * @param {string} [params.sort] - Indicates the order in which the words are to be listed, `alphabetical` or by `count`. You can prepend an optional `+` or `-` to an argument to indicate whether the results are to be sorted in ascending or descending order. By default, words are sorted in ascending alphabetical order. For alphabetical ordering, the lexicographical precedence is numeric values, uppercase letters, and lowercase letters. For count ordering, values with the same count are not ordered. With cURL, URL encode the `+` symbol as `%2B`.
 * @return {Promise} - The Promise that the action returns.
