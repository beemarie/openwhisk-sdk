/**
 * Checks the status of the specified asynchronous job.

 * Returns information about the specified job. The response always includes the status of the job and its creation and update times. If the status is `completed`, the response includes the results of the recognition request. You must submit the request with the service credentials of the user who created the job.   You can use the method to retrieve the results of any job, regardless of whether it was submitted with a callback URL and the `recognitions.completed_with_results` event, and you can retrieve the results multiple times for as long as they remain available.

 * @param {Object} [params.headers]
 * @param {boolean} [params.headers.X-Watson-Learning-Opt-Out=false] - opt-out of data collection
 * @param {string} [params.url] - override default service base url
