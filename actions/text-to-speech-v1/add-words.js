/**
 * Add custom words.
 *
 * Adds one or more words and their translations to the specified custom voice model. Adding a new translation for a word that already exists in a custom model overwrites the word's existing translation. A custom model can contain no more than 20,000 entries.  **Note:** This method is currently a beta release.
 *
 * @param {Object} params - The parameters to send to the service.
 * @param {string} [params.username] - The username used to authenticate with the service. Username and password credentials are only required to run your application locally or outside of Bluemix. When running on Bluemix, the credentials will be automatically loaded from the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.
 * @param {string} [params.password] - The password used to authenticate with the service. Username and password credentials are only required to run your application locally or outside of Bluemix. When running on Bluemix, the credentials will be automatically loaded from the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.
 * @param {Object} [params.headers] - Custom HTTP request headers
 * @param {boolean} [params.headers.X-Watson-Learning-Opt-Out=false] - opt-out of data collection
 * @param {string} [params.url] - override default service base url
 * @param {string} params.customization_id - The GUID of the custom voice model.
 * @param {Word[]} params.words - **When adding words to a custom voice model,** an array of `Word` objects that provides one or more words that are to be added or updated for the custom voice model and the translation for each specified word. **When listing words from a custom voice model,** an array of `Word` objects that lists the words and their translations from the custom voice model. The words are listed in alphabetical order, with uppercase letters listed before lowercase letters. The array is empty if the custom model contains no words.
 * @return {Promise} - The Promise that the action returns.
