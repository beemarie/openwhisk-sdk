/**
 * Adds one or more words to a custom voice model.
 *
 * Adds one or more words and their translations to the custom voice model with the specified `customization_id`. Adding a new translation for a word that already exists in a custom model overwrites the word's existing translation. A custom model can contain no more than 20,000 entries. You must use credentials for the instance of the service that owns a model to add words to it.   **Note:** This method is currently a beta release.
 *
 * @param {Object} params - The parameters to send to the service.
 * @param {string} [params.username] - required unless use_unauthenticated is set.
 * @param {string} [params.password] - required unless use_unauthenticated is set.
 * @param {Object} [params.headers]
 * @param {boolean} [params.headers.X-Watson-Learning-Opt-Out=false] - opt-out of data collection
 * @param {string} [params.url] - override default service base url
 * @param {string} params.customization_id - The GUID of the custom voice model that is to be updated. You must make the request with service credentials created for the instance of the service that owns the custom model.
 * @param {CustomWord[]} params.words - An array of `CustomWord` objects that provides information about the words and their translations that are to be added or updated for the custom voice model.
 * @return {Promise} - The Promise that the action returns.
