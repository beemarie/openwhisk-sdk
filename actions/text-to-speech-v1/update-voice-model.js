/**
 * Updates information and words for a custom voice model.
 *
 * Updates information for the custom voice model with the specified `customization_id`. You can update the metadata such as the name and description of the voice model. You can also update the words in the model and their translations. Adding a new translation for a word that already exists in a custom model overwrites the word's existing translation. A custom model can contain no more than 20,000 entries. You must use credentials for the instance of the service that owns a model to update it.   **Note:** This method is currently a beta release.
 *
 * @param {Object} params - The parameters to send to the service.
 * @param {string} [params.username] - required unless use_unauthenticated is set.
 * @param {string} [params.password] - required unless use_unauthenticated is set.
 * @param {Object} [params.headers]
 * @param {boolean} [params.headers.X-Watson-Learning-Opt-Out=false] - opt-out of data collection
 * @param {string} [params.url] - override default service base url
 * @param {string} params.customization_id - The GUID of the custom voice model that is to be updated. You must make the request with service credentials created for the instance of the service that owns the custom model.
 * @param {string} [params.name] - A new name for the custom voice model.
 * @param {string} [params.description] - A new description for the custom voice model.
 * @param {CustomWord[]} [params.words] - An array of words and their translations that are to be added or updated for the custom voice model. Pass an empty array to make no additions or updates.
 * @return {Promise} - The Promise that the action returns.
