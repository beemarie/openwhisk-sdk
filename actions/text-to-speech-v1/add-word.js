/**
 * Adds a word to a custom voice model.
 *
 * Adds a single word and its translation to the custom voice model with the specified `customization_id`. Adding a new translation for a word that already exists in a custom model overwrites the word's existing translation. A custom model can contain no more than 20,000 entries. You must use credentials for the instance of the service that owns a model to add a word to it.   **Note:** This method is currently a beta release.
 *
 * @param {Object} params - The parameters to send to the service.
 * @param {string} [params.username] - required unless use_unauthenticated is set.
 * @param {string} [params.password] - required unless use_unauthenticated is set.
 * @param {Object} [params.headers]
 * @param {boolean} [params.headers.X-Watson-Learning-Opt-Out=false] - opt-out of data collection
 * @param {string} [params.url] - override default service base url
 * @param {string} params.customization_id - The GUID of the custom voice model that is to be updated. You must make the request with service credentials created for the instance of the service that owns the custom model.
 * @param {string} params.word - The word that is to be added or updated for the custom voice model.
 * @param {string} params.translation - The phonetic or sounds-like translation for the word. A phonetic translation is based on the SSML format for representing the phonetic string of a word either as an IPA translation or as an IBM SPR translation. A sounds-like is one or more words that, when combined, sound like the word.
 * @param {string} [params.part_of_speech] - **Japanese only.** The part of speech for the word. The service uses the value to produce the correct intonation for the word. You can create only a single entry, with or without a single part of speech, for any word; you cannot create multiple entries with different parts of speech for the same word. For more information, see [Working with Japanese entries](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/text-to-speech/custom-rules.html#jaNotes).
 * @return {Promise} - The Promise that the action returns.
