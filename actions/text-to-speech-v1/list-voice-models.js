 * Lists all available custom voice models for a language or for all languages.

 * Lists metadata such as the name and description for the custom voice models that you own. Use the `language` query parameter to list the voice models that you own for the specified language only. Omit the parameter to see all voice models that you own for all languages. To see the words in addition to the metadata for a specific voice model, use the `GET /v1/customizations/{customization_id}` method. You must use credentials for the instance of the service that owns a model to list information about it.   **Note:** This method is currently a beta release.

 * @param {Object} [params.headers]
 * @param {boolean} [params.headers.X-Watson-Learning-Opt-Out=false] - opt-out of data collection
 * @param {string} [params.url] - override default service base url
