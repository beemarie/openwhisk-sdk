The customization weight tells the service how much weight to give to words from the custom language model compared to those from the base model for speech recognition. Specify a value between 0.0 and 1.0. The default value is 0.3.   The default value yields the best performance in general. Assign a higher value if your audio makes frequent use of OOV words from the custom model. Use caution when setting the weight: a higher value can improve the accuracy of phrases from the custom model domain, but it can negatively affect performance on non-domain phrases.   The value that you assign is used for all recognition requests that use the model. You can override it for any recognition request by specifying a customization weight for that request."
