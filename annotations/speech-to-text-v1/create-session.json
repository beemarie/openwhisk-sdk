        "If you specify a `customization_id` when you create the session, you can use the `customization_weight` parameter to tell the service how much weight to give to words from the custom language model compared to those from the base model for recognition requests made with the session.   Specify a value between 0.0 and 1.0. Unless a different customization weight was specified for the custom model when it was trained, the default value is 0.3. A customization weight that you specify overrides a weight that was specified when the custom model was trained.   The default value yields the best performance in general. Assign a higher value if your audio makes frequent use of OOV words from the custom model. Use caution when setting the weight: a higher value can improve the accuracy of phrases from the custom model's domain, but it can negatively affect performance on non-domain phrases."
