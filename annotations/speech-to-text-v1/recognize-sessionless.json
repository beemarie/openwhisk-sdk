Specify a value between 0.0 and 1.0. Unless a different customization weight was specified for the custom model when it was trained, the default value is 0.3. A customization weight that you specify overrides a weight that was specified when the custom model was trained.   The default value yields the best performance in general. Assign a higher value if your audio makes frequent use of OOV words from the custom model. Use caution when setting the weight: a higher value can improve the accuracy of phrases from the custom model domain, but it can negatively affect  performance on non-domain phrases."
